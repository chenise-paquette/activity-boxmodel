        <h1>Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian</h1>
        
        <p>Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian is an Iranian artist and collector of folk art. Her artistic practice weds the geometric patterns and cut-glass mosaic techniques of her Iranian heritage with the rhythms of modern Western geometric abstraction.. </p>
        
        <p>Monir was born in <em>Qazvin</em>, <em>Iran</em>, in 1924, where she studied Fine Arts at the <em>Tehran University</em>. She was one of the first Iranian students to travel to the United States after World War II where she completed her studies at <em>Cornell University</em>. Having graduated from <em>Parsons School of Design</em> in 1949, she became a Member of Source: <a href=http://theartstudentsleague.org/>'New York Art Students League'<a/> (1950-53).Monir's distinguished career has spanned more than five decades. Incorporating traditional reverse glass painting, mirror mosaics and principles of Islamic Geometry with a modern sensibility, her sculptures and installations defy easy categorization.Monir's mirror and reverse glass painting mosaic sculptures are built around principles of Islamic geometry. Through wall based panels and free standing works, she presents both a detailed craft and contemporary abstraction that employs an interaction of surface texture, light and reflection, colour and form. </p>

            <p>She returned to her native country to marry, and continued making art, combining her interpretations of Minimalism and Abstract Expressionism with the time-honored crafts she found at home. A visit to the Shah Cheraq Shrine in Shiraz provided an epiphany: “Imagine stepping inside the center of a diamond and staring at the sun,” says Farmanfarmaian of the experience. The plumes of mirrored hexagons on its crystalline ceilings became the inspiration for the lustrous sculptural mosaics for which Farmanfarmaian has come to be best known and which she continues to make to this day. </p>
